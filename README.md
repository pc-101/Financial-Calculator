# Financial-Calculator
This financial tracker/calculator seeks to act as a basic tool to keep track of one's finances. 
This program can be asked to take down multiple entries, such as monthly rent, grocery expenses,
food expenses, loans, etc. and stores this data in a text file, finances.txt. This acts as the 
program's "Save" method, allowing users to easily alter their list of their current monthly 
spendings so that they could stay within their budget. Although this program does not store the
user's budget, it does calculate the total amount the user has spent based on the entries that
were logged by the program.   

This program allowed me to learn about file handling, lambda functions, and formatting outputs 
to the console amongst other concepts.    

Here is a screenshot of some features that this program offers:
